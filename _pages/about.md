Junjielong Xu is a Ph.D. candidate of Computer Science in the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) (CUHK-SZ). His supervisor is [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io). Before joining CUHK-SZ, he received his BEng degree from the [School of Electronic Information and Communication](https://eic.hust.edu.cn/) at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.cn/) (HUST) in 2022.

🔎 His research focuses on LLM-based DevOps automation for enhancing reliability of code and services, particularly in the areas of (1) logging and root cause analysis (RCA) (2) debugging and automated program repair (APR). He is also interested in recent LLM research topics such as scalable oversight and test-time scaling.

🔑 His objective is to provide non-trivial insights into AI models to address impactful challenges in real-world SE scenarios. He is trying hard to work toward this and hopes to conduct interesting yet meaningful research one day. 🫨

😊 He is currently looking for *visiting* or *internship* opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you are interested and would like to discuss ideas or collaborate on research project.
